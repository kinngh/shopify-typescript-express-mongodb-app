# Shopify TypeScript x Node.js x Express.js x React.js Boilerplate

After getting a lot of feedback on the Javascript version of the repo, I've decided not to build on the TypeScript version. This is mainly because it's near impossible for me to maintain two separate repos due to time constraints. Here are other repos that you may find interesting:

- [Shopify Node.js x Express.js x React.js Boilerplate](https://github.com/kinngh/shopify-node-express-mongodb-app): This repo but in `JavaScript`.
- [Koa x Next.js](https://github.com/kinngh/shopify-node-mongodb-next-app): Starter template based on Shopify's older tech stack of using Koa and Next.js.
- [Polaris Playground](https://github.com/kinngh/shopify-polaris-playground): A playground for Shopify Polaris to allow for building App UI locally and drag/drop directly into this repo to speed up development.
